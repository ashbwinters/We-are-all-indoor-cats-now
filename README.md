Welcome to The Bored Game Guide!

Are you having a game night but don't know what game to play? Let our unamused system help you find the right game for your party. Simply answer a few quiesions and we will begrudgingly provide recommendations. Don't trust us? We don't blame you! We also bullied other players into telling us their opinions about these games so you too can be influenced by the masses! 


Mod1 project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering cohort. 

Produced with Ruby and ActiveRecord and includes SQLite3 databases.

This App will reluctantly give you game night suggestions and let you recommend them to others. Currently, players can store, view and change  their game night recommendations. Since this information is stored in it's database, future versions could make it possible to see and sort games by other player's recommendations.
